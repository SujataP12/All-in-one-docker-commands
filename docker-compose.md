## üîñ Example: Typical Workflow

```bash
docker-compose up -d        # Start services in background
docker-compose logs -f      # Follow logs
docker-compose exec app sh  # Access container shell
docker-compose down         # Stop and clean up
```

#### Here's a docker-compose.yml file that sets up a simple web application with **Node.js** and a **MongoDB database**.

```sh
# docker-compose.yml

version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    container_name: node-app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - MONGO_URL=mongodb://db:27017/mydb
    depends_on:
      - db
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    networks:
      - app-network

  db:
    image: mongo:6
    container_name: mongo-db
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db
    networks:
      - app-network

volumes:
  mongo-data:

networks:
  app-network:

```

| `version: '3.8'`        | Docker Compose file format version.                             |
| `services:`             | Defines all containerized services.                             |
| `app:`                  | The Node.js application container.                              |
| `build: .`              | Builds the image from the Dockerfile in the current directory.  |
| `ports:`                | Maps port 3000 from container to host.                          |
| `environment:`          | Passes environment variables (e.g., MongoDB connection string). |
| `depends_on:`           | Ensures the MongoDB service starts before the app.              |
| `volumes:`              | Mounts current directory into the container.                    |
| `db:`                   | MongoDB service using the official image.                       |
| `volumes:` (under `db`) | Persistent storage for MongoDB data.                            |
| `networks:`             | Creates an isolated network for service communication.          |
